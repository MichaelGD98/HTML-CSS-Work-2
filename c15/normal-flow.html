        <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
        <p>In 1817 Von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal garden faster: two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted
            in a frame upon which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding
            walk.
